# CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

## Overview

Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines to automate code quality checks, testing, and deployment processes. This recipe focuses on creating separate build and test pipelines optimized for both single projects and monorepos.

## Requirements

### Build Pipeline
- Install dependencies and set up project environment
- Run code formatting checks to ensure consistent style
- Execute linting to catch code quality issues
- Perform type checking for statically typed languages
- Build/compile the project to verify it can be packaged

### Test Pipeline
- Install dependencies (may run in parallel with build)
- Execute unit tests and integration tests
- Generate code coverage reports
- Store test results and artifacts for review

### Change Detection
- Configure pipeline to detect relevant file changes
- Skip unnecessary builds when no source code changes occur
- Optimize for monorepo scenarios by running tasks only for affected packages
- Include configuration files, dependencies, and lock files in change detection

### Platform Integration
- Choose appropriate CI/CD platform based on repository hosting
- Configure triggers for pushes, pull requests, and merge events
- Set up proper permissions and secrets management
- Configure artifact storage and deployment targets

## Monorepo Considerations

For projects using monorepo management tools:
- Integrate with framework-specific commands for efficiency
- Use affected project detection to minimize unnecessary work
- Configure smart caching strategies to speed up repeated builds
- Set up proper workspace dependency management
