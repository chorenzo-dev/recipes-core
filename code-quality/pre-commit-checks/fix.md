# Setting up Pre-commit Hooks

## Overview

Pre-commit hooks automatically run quality checks before each commit to maintain code standards. They prevent problematic code from entering the repository by running type checking, linting, and formatting tools.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up pre-commit hooks, verify that quality check scripts or tools exist in your project:
- Type checking commands
- Code formatting commands  
- Code linting commands

Do not proceed if no relevant quality check tools are found.

## General Approach

1. **Identify available quality checks** in your project configuration
2. **Install the pre-commit framework** appropriate for your ecosystem
3. **Configure which checks to run** on staged files
4. **Install the Git hooks** to activate automatic checking
5. **Verify the setup** by testing a commit

## Expected Behavior

Once configured, pre-commit hooks will:
- Run automatically when you attempt to commit
- Check only the files being committed
- Block commits if checks fail
- Provide clear feedback about issues found

## Verification

Test your setup by staging files and attempting a commit. The hooks should run automatically and either allow the commit or provide feedback about issues to fix.
